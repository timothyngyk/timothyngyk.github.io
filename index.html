    <p class="card-text"><p>Hey Tim, Happy Birthday to you! You're now 19 so I think its time you remind yourself there’s a need to grow up yea. HAHA jk! I hope you have a wonderful birthday celebration and enjoy the quality time you can spend with your family. </p>

<p>It has been a true journey we’ve been through together and I am glad to be able to say, it started from a bottle of coke that I actually had no desire to drink so thank you for wasting your time HAHA. You’ve been an amazing pal and brother across the years we’ve known each other and I’m extremely grateful and blessed to have been able to grow closer to you. Thank you for always having my back, sticking together with me throughout difficulties, and always been someone who I know I can fall back on for help or just to share anything that’s on my mind. Although we haven’t yet managed to win our NCC(Sea) PDS District gold medal or achieve the goal of Auxilary Instructor yet, I am glad we continue to do our best and strive for them until now. I strongly believe that one day, we will be able to succeed, and until then let us stay steady till we end well. Watching the effort and dedication you had when you were planning orientation for the new batch of year 5s was also extremely touching. Your willingness to go the extra mile to make an event for others more memorable was just one of the many things you do that reflect amazing person you are. </p>


<p>In all seriousness, I truly have deep admiration for your dedication and desire to constantly grow closer towards God and live out a life that embodies that. I want to thank you so much for helping me to discover God and guide me in my own personal journey as a Christian. Once again, congratulations on making it into NUS Medicine, and I’m sure you’re going to have a great time studying something you feel passionate about. Make sure to keep focused and prioritize what is important to you first and don’t lose sight of your goal to serve others.</p> 

<p>I too find it disappointing that we can’t meet up in real life but once we are able to, lets definitely get together again and have a nice catch-up session. Happy Birthday Tim! May God continue to bless you and your journey of faith!</p>
